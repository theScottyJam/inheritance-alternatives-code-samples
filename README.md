This repository contains a number of different implementations of a MyMap and MyReadonlyMap class.

The "classical inheritance" folder contains an implementation that utilizes inheritance as it gets taught in OOP literature. All of the other directories try to showcase alternative ways to achieve the same implementation. Whether inheritance should have been used with this piece of code in the first place can certainly be debated, but all the same, these code snippets fulfill their purpose of showing other ways to achieve the same effect.
